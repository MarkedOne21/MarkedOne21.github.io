            With over 2 years of experience as a 3D Artist and Modeler, I've had
            the opportunity to bring a wide range of projects to life, from
            gaming to animation and virtual reality.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 font-inter">
            My passion lies in creating detailed and realistic 3D models using
            tools like Blender and ZBrush.

          <p className="mt-2 font-inter">
            I also have a solid background in texturing, rigging, and animation,
            which helps me develop characters and environments that feel dynamic
            and alive
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 font-inter">
            Iâ€™m known for my attention to detail and strong sense of aesthetics,
            and I love collaborating with teams to turn creative ideas into
            reality.
